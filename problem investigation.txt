Problem occurs at high speeds, regardless of torque input.

Tire's start to "rotate' even though they should be point straight
- Calculating the rotation of the wheel wrong (rotMax)
- Wheels start to produce a sideways force and therefore torque unprovoked - although the problem does not exist on the same tires in the Cruden model
- All wheels rotate in the same direction


Problem did not exist when:
- wheels were only driving the rear wheels (old unpowered wheel model)


- Potentially the Front Suspension model was not built to use powered wheels
- The new wheel model not configured properly for use in the front axle
